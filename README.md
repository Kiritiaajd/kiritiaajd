## üíº **Projects**  

### üß† **Brain Stroke Detection using CNNs**
**Repository**: [Brain Stroke Detection](https://github.com/Kiritiaajd/Brain-Stroke-Detection)
This project involves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify brain stroke CT scan images into **hemorrhagic** and **ischemic** classes. I built a custom CNN model with batch normalization, dropout layers, and convolutional layers, achieving a high accuracy rate of 94% on the validation set. The model predicts the likelihood of a brain stroke for patients based on CT scans.

### üè† **California Housing Price Prediction**
**Repository**: [California Housing Prediction](https://github.com/Kiritiaajd/California-Housing-Prediction)
In this project, I built a neural network model using PyTorch for predicting housing prices in California. The dataset contains various features like location, median income, and house age, and the goal is to predict the median house value. I optimized the model by tuning hyperparameters to achieve better prediction accuracy.

### üí¨ **IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis**
**Repository**: [IMDB Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Kiritiaajd/IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis)
I used machine learning techniques to analyze movie reviews from IMDB and classify them as positive or negative. This project involves natural language processing (NLP) techniques like tokenization, stopword removal, and sentiment analysis using a combination of models, including Naive Bayes and LSTM for text classification.

### üìä **CIFAR-10 Image Classification**
**Repository**: [CIFAR-10 Classifier](https://github.com/Kiritiaajd/CIFAR-10-Classifier)
This project focuses on classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes ten different classes of objects. I developed a CNN model with multiple convolutional layers and fully connected layers. The model achieved an accuracy of 90.83% on 10,000 test images.

### üè• **Nurse Stress Prediction**
**Repository**: [Nurse Stress Prediction](https://github.com/Kiritiaajd/Nurse-Stress-Prediction)
In this project, I aimed to predict nurse stress levels based on multiple input features like work hours, hospital environment, and patient interaction. By using machine learning algorithms, I built a predictive model to assess the stress levels and suggest possible solutions for better mental health.

### üîç **Mental Stress Detection**
**Repository**: [Mental Stress Detection](https://github.com/Kiritiaajd/Mental-Stress-Detection)
This project focuses on identifying mental stress through various physiological signals such as heart rate, temperature, and other bio-signals. The goal was to build a real-time model using machine learning algorithms to predict stress levels for early intervention.
